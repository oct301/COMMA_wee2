## COMMA (COnnect Me and MAdcamp) (a.k.a 맫캠시그널)
The SNS platform to connect Mad Camp participants. Users can send notes anonymously to other users if they have. Favoring each other releases the anonymity and reveals each other's names, giving them a chance to get close.


### TAB1

> Cloude Contact List

* List View, circle image view,  : The contacts selected in the local contact list can be uploaded to the server's personal contact database. At this time, we cannot add contact information without email because we require email as essential information. These included contacts function on the server as people in the personal contact database as'friends'. An anonymous message can be sent in the case of a subscriber, and a subscription induction SMS can be sent in the case of a non-subscriber.

### TAB2

> My Profile Photo Setting & Other User's Profile List

* Glide Library, Photo View, Recycler View : Glide library helped to speed up the uploading images. 
On the single image show screen, with the github library, we can zoom in the image. And using the prefer button, can change the selected specific images or all images list.


### TAB3

> Message Box

* Recycler view: Show the messages from other people. By default, messages from other people are delivered anonymously. However, if you send a message to each other at the same time as your partner, you will see the message in real name.


### Server

The server was built using node js and mongo db.

> Node.js Server
* Google Maps, Recycler view: Not a fake splash screen that takes a few seconds, it's actually a step of getting access to the application to run.

> Upload Screen

> Firebase Database and Storage
* Google Firebase :
