## Tab Application : COMMA (COnnect Me and MAdcamp)
The SNS platform to connect Mad Camp participants. Users can send notes anonymously to other users if they have. Favoring each other releases the anonymity and reveals each other's names, giving them a chance to get close.


### TAB1

> Cloude Contact List

* List View,  : The contact information of the restaurants uploaded to Firebase was fetched and displayed in the Recyclerview. Tabs are implemented using fragments and viewpagers. After creating three fragments, we added tabs and viewpagers to the main activity.

### TAB2

> My Profile Photo Setting & Other User's Profile List

* Glide Library, Photo View, Recycler View : Glide library helped to speed up the uploading images. 
On the single image show screen, with the github library, we can zoom in the image. And using the prefer button, can change the selected specific images or all images list.


### TAB3

> Message Box

* Google Maps, Recycler view: With the android's calendar view, we can get them on the tab3. To add the schedules on the specific day, we used recycler view to show the schedules we added by clicking the button at the bottom.
